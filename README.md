# Surfs Up
Weather Analysis using of SQLite, Python, VS Code, and Flask

## Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to compare the weather data in Oahu for the months of June and December to analyze if the Surf Shop would be sustainable year-round. In this analysis, I used the SQLite file containing weather inforation and write queries to collect the data for June and December. From there it was important to calusulate a summary statistics for the 2 months to create a easy to read visual. 


## Results
Through this analysis, a few points can be inferred for the Months of June and December. 
-The average temperature for June was 74°F and 71°F for December. This means that the temperature in Oahu is pleasant enough to serve ice cream year round. 
-The Standard deviation between both months is about 3°F, meaning there is not a large variation of temperature changes during these months. 
-The minimum and max for June was 64°F with a max of 85°F, showing a high temperature and a higher likelhood of people both surfing and purchasing ice cream. The min for December was 56°F and a max of 83%. This shows that there may be days in December where the temperature is low, showing less of a chance of ice cream purchases but with the average at 71°F, the amount of purchases should not decrease dramatically.

## Summary: 
In conclusion, Oahu is a favorable location to establish a surf and ice cream shop, and a promising investment for investors. Through the analysis, there is enpough data to support that weather will not drastically affect the establishment. If we needed to expand the analysis, another query to consider is during Spring and Fall, as the current analysis did not examine those months. Another important factor is the storms that Hawaii experiences, being on a Island, they see periods of bad weather and this is important to consider when having businesses on the coast.
